==================

This design is a work in progress. The initial inspiration for it comes from http://vcard-html.royalmasters.net/ but it will change a lot over the course of development since that is obviously a paid template and I have no intentions of stealing the design. Just using it as a starting point.


Part I
------
Another goal of this project is to break free of writing resumes in Word and spending days redesigning the thing when I get bored of the old design. Instead, I want to be able to redesign it by just re-writing the CSS. And I don't want to do it in LaTeX.

Part II
-------
Decouple content from HTML. This would probably be possible using a templating engine. Maybe I will combine this with the Ember.js stuff in this part and even end up writing a backend for all this.
